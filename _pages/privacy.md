<h4>Website Visitors</h4>

Like most website operators, vNinjaDFW collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. vNinjaDFW’s purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how vNinjaDFW’s visitors use its website. From time to time, vNinjaDFW may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.

vNinjaDFW also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for logged in users and for users leaving comments on our blogs. vNinjaDFW only discloses logged in user and commenter IP addresses under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information as described below, except that blog commenter IP addresses are visible and disclosed to the administrators of the blog where the comment was left.

<h4>Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information</h4>

Certain visitors to vNinjaDFW’s websites choose to interact with vNinjaDFW in ways that require vNinjaDFW to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that vNinjaDFW gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who comment on our blog to provide a username and email address. Those who wish to receive WPBeginner updates via email, we collect their emails. In each case, vNinjaDFW collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor’s interaction with vNinjaDFW. vNinjaDFW does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below. And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities.

<h4>Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information</h4>

vNinjaDFW discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those of its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on vNinjaDFW’s behalf or to provide services available at vNinjaDFW’s websites, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using vNinjaDFW’s websites, you consent to the transfer of such information to them. vNinjaDFW will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations, as described above, vNinjaDFW discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only in response to a subpoena, court order or other governmental request, or when vNinjaDFW believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of vNinjaDFW, third parties or the public at large. If you are a registered user of an vNinjaDFW website and have supplied your email address, vNinjaDFW may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what’s going on with vNinjaDFW and our products. We primarily use our various product blogs to communicate this type of information, so we expect to keep this type of email to a minimum. If you send us a request (for example via a support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users. vNinjaDFW takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.
