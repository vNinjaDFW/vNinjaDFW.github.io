As VMware's licensing and packaging evolves under Broadcom, many customers are evaluating cloud-based alternatives. If you're considering Oracle Cloud VMware Solution (OCVS), you're probably wondering: **What‚Äôs included, and how much does it cost?**

Here‚Äôs a breakdown of what you get with OCVS and how it compares with other VMware cloud offerings.

## üéÅ What‚Äôs Included with OCVS

Each OCVS node includes:

- **vSphere** for compute management  
- **vSAN** for hyperconverged storage (Dense Shapes only)
- **NSX** for network virtualization and security  
- **vCenter Server**  
- **HCX Advanced** for workload migration (Enterprise version also available)

**All licenses are bundled**‚Äîyou don‚Äôt have to bring your own VMware license or deal with complex calculations.

## üí∞ Pricing Model

OCVS uses a **per-host hourly, monthly, yearly (1 or 3) pricing** model based on the shape (e.g., BM.Standard.E3) you choose.

You are billed for:
- **Bare metal compute**
- **VMware software stack (bundled)**
- **OCI infrastructure resources (VCN, storage, etc.)**

No hidden licensing or subscription tiers, unlike some competitors.

## üìâ Cost Comparison (Hypothetical Example)

| Cloud Provider | Hosts | VMware Licensing | Customization | Price Transparency |
|----------------|-------|------------------|----------------|--------------------|
| OCVS           | 3     | Included         | Full Control   | ‚úÖ Clear, itemized |
| AWS VMware     | 3     | Subscription     | Limited        | ‚ùå Bundled tiers   |
| Azure VMware   | 3     | Subscription     | Limited        | ‚ùå Variable pricing|

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Licensing Changes Under Broadcom

With Broadcom consolidating VMware products into a few bundles, understanding what‚Äôs included in your cloud provider's VMware stack is more important than ever. OCVS simplifies this.

## ‚úÖ Summary

If you're looking for clarity and control in your VMware cloud deployment, OCVS offers transparent pricing and a comprehensive feature set‚Äîwithout the guesswork or surprise license audits.
