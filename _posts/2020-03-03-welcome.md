Welcome to my blog! The goal of this blog is to share everyday encounters with Customers all over the world. I am currently working in the VMware Professional Services organization and traveling all across the US. I love being able to engage in the design, implementation and documentation of system architecture initiatives. I also lead client discussions at C-level on virtualization principles, process, automation, strategy & design. Please reach out to me if there are any specific VMware issues or products you want to know more about!
