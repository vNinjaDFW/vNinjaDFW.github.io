In March of 2019, I was HONORED to be accepted into the VMware vExpert program. The VMware vExpert program is VMware's global evangelism and advocacy program. The program is designed to put VMware's marketing resources towards your advocacy efforts. Promotion of your articles, exposure at our global events, co-op advertising, traffic analysis, and early access to beta programs and VMware's roadmap. The awards are for individuals, not companies, and last for one year. Employees of both customers and partners can receive the awards. In the application, we consider various community activities from the previous year as well as the current year's (only for 2nd half applications) activities in determining who gets awards. We look to see that not only were you active but are still active in the path you chose to apply for.

I was doing activities 6 months before applying in order to meet the requirements for this program. If you didn't make it into the program this time, there is another application process in June that I can help you work towards now. Reah out to me with any questions that you might have. Some of the things that I did were:
1. VMTN - Help answer questions
2. VMUG - Get your face\name out there
3. Join a Cloud Credibility Team
4. VMware Social Advocacy
5. Applied for the Customer track (before I joined PSO)
