A potent method to enable networking and security across containerized apps is to deploy NSX-T coupled with Kubernetes clusters. Organizations can build dynamic, scalable, and secure network infrastructures using the software-defined networking and security platform known as NSX-T. The deployment, scaling, and administration of containerized applications are all automated by the widely used container orchestration software Kubernetes. A unified platform for network and security policy administration and improved visibility into containerized workloads are both made possible by integrating NSX-T with Kubernetes clusters.

The procedures needed to deploy NSX-T coupled with Kubernetes clusters will be covered in this blog.

<h5>Step 1: Create the NSX-T Infrastructure</h5>

Setting up the NSX-T infrastructure is the first step in implementing NSX-T coupled with Kubernetes. Installing NSX-T Manager, the centralized administration platform for NSX-T, as well as NSX-T Controllers, which offer control plane services to the NSX-T data plane, is required to do this.

<h5>Step 2: Install the NSX Container Plugin</h5>

The Kubernetes component known as the NSX Container Plugin (NCP) enables integration between Kubernetes and NSX-T. In the Kubernetes cluster, NCP runs as a pod and interacts with NSX-T to set up load balancers, firewalls, and logical switches. Follow the directions in the NSX-T handbook to install NCP.

<h5>Step 3: Build a Kubernetes cluster</h5>

Use your favorite approach to construct a Kubernetes cluster, such as native Kubernetes tools, managed Kubernetes services like EKS, GKE, or AKS, or Kubernetes deployment tools like kubeadm or kops. Check to see if the Kubernetes version you select is compatible with the NCP version you set up.

<h5>Step 4: Setup the NSX-T Policy API Server</h5>

NSX-T network and security objects are created and managed by the NSX-T Policy API Server. You must make an API server configuration file that contains details about the NSX-T infrastructure and the Kubernetes cluster in order to configure the NSX-T Policy API Server. A Kubernetes secret should be used to save the configuration file.

<h5>Step 5: Install the NSX-T CNI Plugin</h5>

A Kubernetes component known as the NSX-T CNI (Container Network Interface) Plugin offers networking access for pods running within the Kubernetes cluster. The CNI Plugin interacts with the NCP to set up logical switches and network connectivity while running as a daemon set in the Kubernetes cluster. Follow the directions in the NSX-T documentation to install the NSX-T CNI Plugin.

<h5>Step 6: Test the deployment</h5>

It's crucial to test the deployment after NSX-T integrated with Kubernetes has been installed and configured to make sure everything is operating as it should. To confirm that the Kubernetes pods are running and that NSX-T logical switches and load balancers are properly configured, you can use NSX-T tools like the NSX-T GUI or Kubernetes tools like kubectl.

In conclusion, using Kubernetes clusters in conjunction with NSX-T deployments gives you a strong platform for managing network and security policy in containerized environments. You may set up a reliable and expandable infrastructure that offers a unified view of your network and security rules across Kubernetes clusters by following the procedures indicated above.
