Deploying NSX-T integrated with Kubernetes clusters is a powerful way to enable networking and security across containerized applications. NSX-T is a software-defined networking and security platform that allows organizations to create dynamic, scalable, and secure network infrastructures. Kubernetes, on the other hand, is a popular container orchestration platform that automates the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. Integrating NSX-T with Kubernetes clusters provides a unified platform for network and security policy management, as well as increased visibility into containerized workloads.

In this blog, we will discuss the steps required to deploy NSX-T integrated with Kubernetes clusters.

<h5>Step 1: Set up the NSX-T Infrastructure</h5>

The first step in deploying NSX-T integrated with Kubernetes is to set up the NSX-T infrastructure. This involves installing NSX-T Manager, which is the centralized management platform for NSX-T, and NSX-T Controllers, which provide control plane services to the NSX-T data plane.

<h5>Step 2: Install the NSX Container Plugin</h5>

The NSX Container Plugin (NCP) is a Kubernetes component that provides integration between Kubernetes and NSX-T. NCP runs as a pod in the Kubernetes cluster and communicates with NSX-T to create logical switches and configure load balancers and firewalls. To install NCP, follow the instructions provided in the NSX-T documentation.

<h5>Step 3: Create a Kubernetes Cluster</h5>

Next, create a Kubernetes cluster using your preferred method, such as Kubernetes native tools, managed Kubernetes services like EKS, GKE or AKS, or Kubernetes deployment tools like kubeadm or kops. Make sure that the Kubernetes version you choose is compatible with the version of NCP you installed.

<h5>Step 4: Configure the NSX-T Policy API Server</h5>

The NSX-T Policy API Server is responsible for creating and managing NSX-T network and security objects. To configure the NSX-T Policy API Server, you will need to create an API server configuration file that includes information about the NSX-T infrastructure and the Kubernetes cluster. The configuration file should be saved as a Kubernetes secret.

<h5>Step 5: Install the NSX-T CNI Plugin</h5>

The NSX-T CNI (Container Network Interface) Plugin is a Kubernetes component that provides networking connectivity for pods running in the Kubernetes cluster. The CNI Plugin runs as a daemon set in the Kubernetes cluster and communicates with the NCP to create logical switches and configure network connectivity. To install the NSX-T CNI Plugin, follow the instructions provided in the NSX-T documentation.

<h5>Step 6: Test the Deployment</h5>

Once you have completed the installation and configuration of NSX-T integrated with Kubernetes, it is important to test the deployment to ensure that everything is working as expected. You can use Kubernetes tools like kubectl or NSX-T tools like the NSX-T GUI to verify that the Kubernetes pods are running and that NSX-T logical switches and load balancers are properly configured.

In conclusion, deploying NSX-T integrated with Kubernetes clusters provides a powerful platform for network and security policy management in containerized environments. By following the steps outlined above, you can set up a robust and scalable infrastructure that provides a unified view of your network and security policies across Kubernetes clusters.
