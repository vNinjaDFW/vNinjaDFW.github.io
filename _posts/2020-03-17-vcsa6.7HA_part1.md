<h3>vCenter HA Requirements</h3>

- ESXi 6.0 or later with a minimum of three ESXi Hosts <i>(more about HA\DRS later)</i>
- Deployment size of small or bigger is required to meet the RTO
    <i>Do NOT use Tiny in production environments</i>
- The vCenter HA network must be on a different subnet than the management network.
- The vCenter HA network latency between Active, Passive, and Witness nodes must be less than 10 ms.
- vCenter HA requires a single vCenter Server license. (Standard)

<h3>Firewall Port Requirements for the HA Network</h3>
