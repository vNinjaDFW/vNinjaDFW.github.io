As of version 6.5, vCenter came with an HA (High Availability) option for the Appliance. With 6.7u1, with now have an even more simplified implementation ability. This article is a part one introduction to the HA setup process and some of the basic requirements. I will create additional posts which detail the advanced setup as well as some of the troubleshooting I've used.

<h3>vCenter HA Components</h3>

- Active Appliance (Deployed vCSA)
- Passive Appliance (Full clone of Active)
- Witness Appliance (lightweight clone of Active)
    <i>Only has NIC1 (HA Network) configured for split-brain protection </i>

<h3>vCenter HA Requirements</h3>

- ESXi 6.0 or later with a minimum of three ESXi Hosts <i>(more about HA\DRS later)</i>
- Deployment size of small or bigger is required to meet the RTO
    <i>Do NOT use Tiny in production environments</i>
- The vCenter HA network must be on a different subnet than the management network.
- The vCenter HA network latency between Active, Passive, and Witness nodes must be less than 10 ms.
- vCenter HA requires a single vCenter Server license. (Standard)
